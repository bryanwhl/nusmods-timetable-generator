# NUSMods Timetable Scheduler (NUS Hack&Roll Hackathon Project)

Have you ever felt like your timetable could be improved? NUS Timetable Scheduler allows you to 
input your preferences for your timetable and our algorithms will customise the best suited timetable for you based on your
preferences. All you need to do is to key in the module codes of the modules that you are going to take for the upcoming 
semester, your academic year/semester and your preferences and an nusmods.com link will be generated for you to view your 
recommended timetable.
